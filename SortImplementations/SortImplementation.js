// Create a new project. Create a separate file for each of the sorts described in the previous lessons.
// Follow the instructions below for implementing each sort.
// When you have completed all of the sorts, submit a link to your repo.
// Bubble Sort
// Use the pseudo-code from the Bubble Sort overview reading to implement a bubble sort of an array. Try to create a helper function to assist you in the swapping.

// Selection Sort
// Use the pseudo-code from the Selection Sort overview reading to implement a selection sort of an array. This is another great case to use a helper function to assist with the swap.

// Insertion Sort
// Use the pseudo-code from the Insertion Sort overview reading to implement an insertion sort of an array.

// Merge Sort
// Use the pseudo-code from the Merge Sort overview reading to implement a merge sort of an array. This should utilize two functions. One for the sort, and one for the merge.

// Quick Sort
// Use the pseudo-code from the Quick Sort overview reading to implement a quick sort of an array.
